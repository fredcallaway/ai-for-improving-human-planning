# AI for improving human planning

This repository contains data and analysis code for "Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Improve Peopleâ€™s Planning Strategies" submitted to PNAS in March 2020.

The code for Experiment 1 (with a modification that allows you to select your own condition) is in `demo-experiment`. You can view the demo experiment yourself at https://cocosci.dreamhosters.com/webexpt/improving-planning/

Experiments 1-4 are analyzed in main.ipynb. Experiments 5-8 analyzed in separate notebooks, named exp[5-8].ipynb.
